Under your dialectOptions, add an additional property called dialectOptions whose value is an object. That object should contain a property called ssl whose value is also an object (so weâ€™ve got an object in an object in an object). The innermost object should have a rejectUnauthorized property whose value is false. This is required for nearly all external databases.
